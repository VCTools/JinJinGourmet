                                </p>

                                <p><strong>16.1.</strong> Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place
                                    of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes the Regulation.</p>

                                    not handle a complaint or does not inform the data subject within three months on the progress or outcome of the complaint lodged pursuant to Article 16.</p>

                                <p><strong>19.2.</strong> Member States may provide that any body, organisation or association referred to in paragraph 19.1 of this Article, independently of a data subject's mandate, has the right to lodge, in that Member State, a complaint with the

                                <p><strong>20. Right to compensation and liability</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>20.2. </strong> Any controller involved in processing is liable for the damage caused by processing which infringes this Regulation. The processor is liable for the damage caused by processing only where it has not complied with obligations
                                    of the Regulation specifically directed to processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the Controller.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>20.3.</strong> The controller or processor shall be exempt from liability under paragraph 20.2 if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>

                                    controller or processor shall be held liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation of the data subject.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>20.5.</strong> Where a controller or processor has, in accordance with paragraph 20.4., paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller or processor shall be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or processors involved
                                    in the same processing that part of the compensation corresponding to their part of responsibility for the damage, in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 18.2.</p>
                                <p><strong>20.6.</strong> Court proceedings for exercising the right to receive compensation is brought before the courts competent under the law of the Member State referred to in 18.2.</p>

                                <p>Where the processing is based on: i) the consent of the data subject given for processing his/her personal data for one or more specific purposes; or ii) the consent of the data subject given for processing certain special personal data for one or
                                    more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition to process special personal data may not be lifted by the data subject,
                                    <br> the data subject has the right to withdraw the consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on the consent before its withdrawal.
                                    <br> For the sake of clarity the withdrawal of the consent shall not affect the processing of the personal data based on other legal basis.</p>

                                <p><strong>Category 4 - Targeting cookies or advertising cookies</strong></p>
                                <p>These cookies will usually be third-party cookies, although if a user is visiting the advertising network’s own website it is technically possible these could be first party. They will always be persistent but time-limited cookies. These cookies can
                                be associated with services provided by the third party but this is not always the case. These cookies contain a unique key that is able to distinguish individual users’ browsing habits or that can be translated into a set of browsing habits or
                                preferences using information stored elsewhere. Generally speaking, the privacy statement should indicate if the cookie is being used as part of an advertising network. Cookies may also be used to limit the number times a user sees a particular

                                <p>Examples include:</p>
                                <p> • Cookies placed by advertising networks to collect browsing habits in order to target relevant adverts to the user. The site the user is visiting need not actually be serving adverts, but often this will also be the case.</p>
                                <p> • Cookies placed by advertising networks in conjunction with a service implemented by the website to increase functionality, such as commenting on a blog, adding a site to the user’s social network, providing maps or counters of visitors to a site.</p>
                                <p>By default, the web ordering application and its originating website URL is not serving category 4 cookies. However, it may be possible to order online from other websites that frame-in or facilitate access to the online menu and web application.
                                Therefore, please always check the cookie policy of the visited website from which you initiated an online ordering session in order to find out if any category 4 cookies are served and which is the way to opt-out or opt-in for them, as the legal
                                case may be.</p>
